# Android with C++ & JNI: StrokeMatching

In 2020, I and the team built Aksaraya, an Indonesian traditional script learning app designed for iOS. One of its features is "Stroke Matching," which matches the user's drawn strokes. This repository contains a sample implementation of the 'Stroke Matching' feature for Android, using C++ with JNI."

# How to make default strokes
-  Uncomment the code related to the button in both "MainActivity" and "activity_main.xml" files.
- Comment out the code at "PaintView" line 84, lines 87-95, and "MainActivity" line 36.
- Run the project.
- Create your own strokes and save them.
- Afterward, don't forget to comment and uncomment the above steps to use the "Stroke Matching" feature.
